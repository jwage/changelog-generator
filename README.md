This library will generate a changelog markdown document from a GitHub milestone. It is based off of
[weierophinney/changelog_generator](https://github.com/weierophinney/changelog_generator).

- [Grouped by GitHub labels](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator#003)
- [Write changelog to a file](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator#write-to-file)
- [Multi-Project configuration](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator#configuration-file)

- [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator#github-enterprise-support)

## Installation

You can install with composer:

    $ composer require jwage/changelog-generator

Or you can download the latest `changelog-generator.phar` file from the [releases](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/releases) pages.

## Example

Here is what an example changelog looks like. It was generated from the `0.0.3` milestone in GitHub for this project:

### 0.0.3

- Total issues resolved: **7**
- Total pull requests resolved: **7**
- Total contributors: **1**

#### Enhancement

 - [13: Allow changelog configurations to be provided via a php config file.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/13) thanks to @jwage
 - [12: Allow changelog to be filtered by label names.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/12) thanks to @jwage
 - [11: Add total contributors to changelog.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/11) thanks to @jwage
 - [9: Improve changelog totals to be split by issue and pull requests.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/9) thanks to @jwage
 - [7: Link pull requests and issues together to improve the changelog format.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/7) thanks to @jwage
 - [6: Allow changelog to be written to a file.](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/pull/6) thanks to @jwage

You can also look at the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jwage/changelog-generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file which
is generated by this project.

## Basic Usage

Generate a change log based on a GitHub milestone with the following command:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0

## Write to File

Write the generated changelog to a file with the `--file` option. If you don't provide a value, it will be written
to the current working directory in a file named `CHANGELOG.md`:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --file

You can pass a value to `--file` to specify where the changelog file should be written:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --file=changelog.md

By default it will overwrite the file contents but you can pass the `--append` option to append the changelog to
the existing contents.

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --file=changelog.md --append

If you want to prepend the changelog to an existing file, use the `--prepend` option:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --file=changelog.md --prepend

## Connecting Issues & Pull Requests

To make the changelog easier to read, we try to connect pull requests to issues by looking for `#{ISSUE_NUMBER}` in the body
of the pull request. When the user of the issue and pull request are different github users, the changelog line will look like the following:

- [634: Fix namespace in bin/doctrine-migrations.php](https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/pull/634) thanks to @Majkl578 and @jwage

## Filtering by Labels

You can filter the changelog by label names using the `--label` option:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --label=Enhancement --label=Bug

## Including Open Issues & Pull Requests

It can be convenient when preparing release notes for an upcoming release to include open issues and pull requests. For
this you can use the `--include-open` option:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --include-open

## Including Date after the Milestone

For a good changelog your like show the release date of each version. For this you can use the `--include-date` option:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --user=doctrine --repository=migrations --milestone=2.0 --include-date

## Configuration File

You can provide a PHP configuration file to the changelog generator if you don't want to provide the data manually each time.
Put the following contents in a file named `config.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use ChangelogGenerator\ChangelogConfig;

return [
    'changelog-generator' => (new ChangelogConfig())
        ->setUser('jwage')
        ->setRepository('changelog-generator')
        ->setMilestone('0.0.4')
        ->setLabels(['Enhancement', 'Bug'])
        ->setIncludeOpen(true)
        ->setIncludeDate(true)
    ,
    'another-project' => (new ChangelogConfig())
        // ...
    ,
];
```

Then you can use the configuration file like the following:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --config=config.php

By default it will generate a changelog for the first changelog config in the array returned by the file. You can use the
`--project` option if you want to generate a changelog for a specific project in the config file:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --config=config.php --project=another-project

By default if you name your config file `changelog-generator-config.php`, the changelog generator will look for that file
if no `--config` option is passed.

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate

You can override options provided by the `ChangelogConfig` object from the command line by passing options to the
`generate` command:

    $ ./vendor/bin/changelog-generator generate --include-open=0

## GitHub Enterprise Support

You can configure the URL of your GitHub instance by using the `rootGitHubUrl` option. In your `config.php` you can
pass a 5th argument to `ChangelogConfig` that contains an array of options:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use ChangelogGenerator\ChangelogConfig;

return [
    'changelog-generator' => (new ChangelogConfig())
        ->setUser('jwage')
        ->setRepository('changelog-generator')
        ->setMilestone('0.0.3')
        ->setLabels(['Enhancement', 'Bug'],)
        ->setOption('rootGitHubUrl', 'https://git.mycompany.com/api/v3')
    ,
];
```
